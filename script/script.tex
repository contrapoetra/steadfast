\extslug{Boat. Sea - Day}

A tin can rolls along the floor of the lifeboat, after which someone walks over it. This is \textbf{ROMY}, anxious and grumpy. He sits on the other edge of the boat across \textbf{ELIJAH}, his colleague wearing a windbreaker and a keffiyeh around his neck, looking at the compass and adjusts the steer. Romy ruffles through his notebook, looking at an array of numbers, ending with 21.

\begin{dialogue}[]{Romy}
    Um, I lost track. Do you remember the day count?
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[flipping pages]{Elijah}
    Uhh... 87th.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[]{Romy}
    Have you not seen anything at all? The mountains?
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[]{Elijah}
    The mountains? No. I see the storm behind you.
\end{dialogue}

Romy flicks his head to see what's behind him. It's a huge clump of dark clouds, with occasional flashes of light in it. He then flicks his head back, staring at Elijah.

\begin{dialogue}{Romy}
    Eli...
\end{dialogue}

\extslug{Boat. Sea - Continuous}

KABOOM... a huge wave swerves the boat askew, almost flipping it. Elijah carefully adjusts the steer as his compass fell off his hands and slid to the other side of the boat, where Romy tries to keep the engine running. Their boat is now drenched in the rain, while thunderstorm strikes everywhere near them.

\begin{dialogue}[at the top of his lungs]{Elijah}
    GET MY COMPASS!
\end{dialogue}

The intense storm muffled his sounds, but Romy did pick up that Elijah was calling out to him.

\begin{dialogue}{Romy}
    WHAT?
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Elijah}
    MY COMPASS IS SOMEWHERE NEAR YOU!
\end{dialogue}

Romy looks down and found the compass. He picks it up, runs to the other side of the boat only to get blasted sideways by a splash of water, knocking him to the side. He promptly stood back up and gives Elijah the compass.

\extslug{Boat. Sea - Continuous}

The horizon is clear and the boat is drenched, just like Elijah and Romy, shivering out in the cold of the sea. Elijah takes his windbreaker and throws it at Romy.

\begin{dialogue}{Elijah}
    Here. You seem to be having it worse.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Romy}
    Dude. It's literally drenched.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Elijah}
    Just put it on. Yeah it'll be cold but then it'll be way better.
\end{dialogue}

\extslug{Boat. Sea - Continuous}

The water looks good, calm. The boys are sitting across from each other. Romy, still wearing Elijah's windbreaker, is agitated.

\begin{dialogue}{Romy}
    I feel so tired.
\end{dialogue}

Elijah who was writing on his notebook, stops and looks at Romy.

\begin{dialogue}{Elijah}
    What does that mean?
\end{dialogue}

Romy stands up.

\begin{dialogue}{Romy}
    I'm gonna take The Shortcut.
\end{dialogue}

Elijah could not believe what he was hearing.

    \hspace{1.2in} ELIJAH

    Wait, hold /on a second. 

    &

    \hspace{1.2in} ROMY

    This trip makes no sense, Eli. It has been almost 100 days and we have seen no one. Not even a glimpse of a landscape. All we have seen so far is our stock nearing the end, storms, and you and me losing sanity. I don't even remember how we ended up here. How this whole trip started. Do you?
\end{tabularx}

Elijah is stunned.

\begin{dialogue}{Romy}
    I really doubt that you do. Now, please. I know you have it. I can't take this anymore.
\end{dialogue}

Elijah contemplates. There is one thing he can do to prevent what Romy is about to do to himself.

\begin{dialogue}{Elijah}
    You need to calm down Romy. Panick and stress drains your energy just as well. I'm going to tell you something. You don't remember how we got here, but you surely do remember what happens if you take The Shortcut? Taking it only skips the trip. Not completing it. One day you will have to redo this trip again to make up for it. You will lose twice as much energy. Remember the story of Siti Hajar, the spouse of Abraham?
\end{dialogue}

\extslug{Safa and Marwa Hills - Day}

In slow motion, we see glimpses of a woman putting her baby down and running down the hill.

\begin{dialogue}{Elijah (V.O)}
    She had to run from one hill to another and back, just to look for water for her baby.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{The Woman (in Arabic)}
    I'll be back.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Elijah (V.O, CONT'D)}
    Every pool of water she sees on the other side of the hills are illusions, but she remains steadfast looking for water, for her baby. Then she finds it. Right by her baby.
\end{dialogue}

}

\extslug{Boat. Sea - Continuous}

Elijah takes his keffiyeh off, and then his necklace, and from it he takes a pill. The Shortcut. He holds it up.

\begin{dialogue}{Elijah}
    Now, do you want to do this another time, or remain steadfast?
\end{dialogue}

\extslug{Beach - Continuous}

The boys arrive at the beach. Beautiful, lush greenery and white sands. They get off their boat and take their belongings, and they walk, exiting our left. As they do that, we see flashes of patches, behind them and all over. It's like a studio, a white, minimalist room, behind this whole scenery.
